# BCE_Report_Age_of_Memes

It gives us immense pleasure to present this report in project named "THE AGE OF MEMES" undertaken by third year engineering students(COMPUTER ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT) as a part of curriculum under the subject entitled 'BUSINESS COMMUNICATION AND ETHICS'
It gives us immense joy that we find ourselves penning down these lines to express our sincere thanks to the people who helped us along the way in completing our project. We find inadequate words to express our sincere gratitude towards them.
First and foremost we would like to express our gratitude towards our project guide # Dr.Vijay Songire sir 
for placing complete faith and confidence in our ability to carry out this project and for providing us his time, inspiration, encouragement, help and valuable guidance. Without the sincere and honest guidance of our respected sir we would not have been to reach the present stage.
